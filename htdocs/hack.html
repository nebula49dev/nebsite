      <h3> Now I'm gonna roast you. </h3>
      <footer> But if you are my teacher reading this right now you are a very kind man.
<br>     But for the rest of you neckbeards checking every last bit of my code:
      </footer>
        <ul>
<li> You're more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel </li>
<li> You smell like hotdog water </li>
<li> If you were a seasoning you would be flour </li>
<li> You are a grey sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake </li>
<li> You look like you were drawn with my left hand </li>
        </ul>

<p> But seriously, this code is entirely free to use and the main home page is well <br>
commented, so go ahead and check my stuff out. </p>
