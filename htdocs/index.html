<h2>About me</h2>
<p> I am a developer who makes whatever I feel like.
I don't make any profit and I am completely solo. I do
this entirely for fun and I really enjoy doing things
the hard way. </p>
      <aside>
        This web page was made entirely by me with HTML5,
        and the code is completely free and open source.
        You can use this without giving me any credit.
